## ðŸ”¹ Implementation Architecture

### Request Classes
All business rules are primarily enforced through Laravel Form Request classes:
- `CreateProgramRequest.php`
- `UpdateProgramRequest.php`
- `CreateEquipmentRequest.php`
- `UpdateEquipmentRequest.php`
- `CreateFacilityRequest.php`
- `UpdateFacilityRequest.php`
- `CreateServiceRequest.php`
- `UpdateServiceRequest.php`
- `CreateProjectRequest.php`
- `UpdateProjectRequest.php`
- `CreateParticipantRequest.php`
- `UpdateParticipantRequest.php`

### Model Enforcement
Critical business rules are also enforced at the model level using Eloquent boot methods:
- **Program**: Lifecycle protection on deletion
- **Equipment**: Delete guard and usage domain validation
- **Facility**: Deletion constraints 
- **Service**: Delete guard for testing requirements
- **Participant**: Project assignment protection

### Controller Integration
All controllers have been updated to:
- Use the appropriate Request classes for validation
- Handle business rule violations gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Implement proper exception handling

### Database Constraints
The business rules work in conjunction with existing database migrations and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity at multiple levels.

## ðŸ”¹ Testing and Validation

The business rules can be tested by:
1. **Form Validation**: Submit forms with invalid data to see validation messages
2. **API Testing**: Send invalid requests to API endpoints
3. **Direct Model Testing**: Attempt to create/update models that violate business rules
4. **Deletion Testing**: Try to delete entities that have dependent relationships

## ðŸ”¹ Error Handling

All business rules provide:
- **Clear error messages** that match the specifications
- **Graceful failure handling** that doesn't crash the application
- **User-friendly feedback** in the web interface
- **Consistent validation** across create and update operations

This comprehensive implementation ensures that your Laravel application enforces all the specified business rules while maintaining data integrity and providing excellent user experience.
